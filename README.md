# Every Programmer Should Know :thinking:
A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.

:point_up: *These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack*

Highly opinionated :bomb:. Not backed by science.
Comes in no particular order :recycle:

U like it? :star: it and [share](https://twitter.com/mr_mig_by/status/900735231552098306) with a friendly developer!
U don't like it? [Watch the doggo](https://twitter.com/RespectfulMemes/status/900147758845308930) :dog:

*P.S. You [don't need to know](https://xkcd.com/1050/) all of that by heart to be a programmer.
But knowing the stuff will help you become better! :muscle:*

*P.P.S. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!*

### Platform Engineering

> A modern discipline that evolved from DevOps and SRE principles, focused on improving developer experience and productivity by building and managing self-service tools and workflows, often through an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). The goal is to reduce cognitive load on developers and streamline the path to production.

- **What is Platform Engineering?**
    * [Microsoft Learn: What is platform engineering?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/platform-engineering/what-is-platform-engineering)  
    A comprehensive overview of the practice, its goals, and core capabilities.
    * [Atlassian: What is Platform Engineering?](https://www.atlassian.com/developer-experience/platform-engineering)  
    A great explanation of the roles and responsibilities of a platform team.

- **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**
    * [internaldeveloperplatform.org: What is an IDP?](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/)  
    A foundational resource explaining the concept of an IDP as the core product of a platform team.
    * [Atlassian: Internal Developer Platform Guide](https://www.atlassian.com/developer-experience/internal-developer-platform)  
    A deep dive into the benefits and best practices for building an IDP.

- **Golden Paths (Paved Roads)**
    * [Spotify Engineering: How we use Golden Paths to solve fragmentation](https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/onboarding-software-to-backstage/setting-up-software-templates/11-spotify-templates/)  
    The original concept from Spotify, explaining how they use "opinionated and supported paths" to guide developers.
    * [Red Hat: What is a Golden Path for software development?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/golden-paths)  
    * A clear article on how Golden Paths provide templates and standardized workflows to increase efficiency.
